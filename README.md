# Todo-Void
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/shostakovich/Todo-Void.png)](http://travis-ci.org/shostakovich/TodoVoid)

A simple application to remember what to do and what you did. In the terminal, clutter free and completly unspectacular.

## Installation

Todo-Void is a ruby gem. Its currently under heavy development and you should have a backup strategie for your todo-file ;)

	gem install todo-void
	

## Use

Try these commands:

* t "Mow the lawn" (Add todo)
* t (Show all todos)
* t -s 41 (Start todo)
* t -f 41 (Finish todos)
* t -d 41 (Delete todos)

You may also look this up in the /features directory within the source code.

## Plans

Plans for the future are:

* Projects support
* Improvements
	* Hide done tasks after a while
	* Recuring tasks (in a very simple way)	* Nice and polished error messages and perfect help
	* Edit todos
* Maybe some kind of cloud-sync / backup
